Turtle Drawings

What all of the functions you wrote to create your drawings do.
  All final chosen drawings are made with the same function, just with different number of iterations. The chosen function is one that randomizes shape, colour, size, coordinates, and distance while recording these choices into a list of dictionaries. Among the shape choices, every circle and stars will be filled with a random colour. 
Your working method for creating your program.
  I started off with more simpler functions with less variables that are random. I did trial and errors after every function to see what it would look like. I was mainly inspired by a VOX video about an experiment on algorithmic drawings. In this video the algorithm was told to produce a series of abstracted representations of certain objects, and have people try and guess them; only a handful were recognized correctly. This made me think of how humans are still the end consumer and that humans are still the one that are responsible to make sense of the output. I wanted to reflect this by having the drawings made completely randomized as if the algorithm is drawing all by itself, showing it's own thinking. Then, have humans make sense of the images generated to tell the story. 
Difficulties you encountered along the way.
  I have found that I couldn't save the drawings after generating all of them. Because of this, I have to restart all of them, and since it's randomized, all the draings generated are different.
Resources that were helpful in problem solving.
  None.
How you might improve or expand your work in the future.
  Make much more complex shapes that would allow the function to generate much more dynamic images. Right now they are only made with common shapes.
  
The images that I chose have similar colour schemes and sense of movement that makes sense in the series. Looking through all of the images generated, I created a series of images that seem to show a burst of emotions, idea or a start of a dream. 

Reflecting on the assignment, I think it is still quite a hassle to generate images through codes, rather than physically doing it. However, it does produce digital ready images that are crisp and high definition. Currently I am still unsure how I can integrate this in my field as an Industrial Designer, but it does make me interested in areas of digital arts and design, and am interested in exploring those fields.
